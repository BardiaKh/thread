[Thread](https://www.thread.dev) is a Jupyter Notebook that combines the experience of OpenAI's code interpreter with the familiar development environment of a Python notebook. With Thread, you can use natural language to generate cells, edit code, ask questions or fix errors all while being able to edit or re-run code as you would in a regular Jupyter Notebook.

Best of all, Thread runs locally, and can be used for free with your own API key. To start:

```
pip install thread-dev
```

To start thread-dev, run the following

```
thread
```

or

```
jupyter thread
```

# Feature Roadmap

These are some of the features we are hoping to launch in the next few month. If you have any suggestions or would like to see a feature added, please don't hesitate to open an issue or reach out to us [via email](mailto:ali@vizlylabs.com) or [discord](https://discord.gg/ZuHq9hDs2y).

-   [ ] Add co-pilot style inline code suggestions
-   [ ] Data warehouse + SQL support
-   [ ] No code data exploration
-   [ ] UI based chart creation
-   [ ] Ability to collaborate on notebooks
-   [ ] Publish notebooks as shareable webapps

# Thread.dev Cloud

Eventually we hope to provide Thread as a shareable web app with lots of collaboration features. As part of this, we are looking for initial enterprise design partners that might be interested in partnering with us on this. If you're interested, please reach out to us [via email](mailto:ali@vizlylabs.com) or [join our waitlist](https://waitlist.thread.dev).
